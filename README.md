# Exchange-Rate-Classification
This project dealt with the prediction of USD/TRL weekly exchange rate directional movements from fundamental macro-economic factors. It used classification models to predict whether the Lira would depreciate or appreciate with respect to the Dollar in a given week, based on the movements of various macro-economic factors. It has various practical applications in international transactional cash flows, forex trading etc.

The macroeconomic variables used were:
-	Inflation rate differential between USA and Turkey 
-	Interest rate differential between USA and Turkey
-	The differential of the GDP growth rate between USA and Turkey
-	The unemployment level differential between USA and Turkey
-	Turkeyâ€™s external debt
